CGAN_Project_ML_50024

Please see the .ipynb Jupyter Notebook to see the output of the cGAN. Training, Image Generation, and Model Evaluation all occurs in this file. Output from training has been cleared, but image generation and evaluation output is maintained. Models are saved off in repository for evaluation.

All training was executed on Google Lambda Cloud, so some output will not be available in Jupyter Notebook (such as Loss Plots, etc.). Figures are saved into repository for viewing.
