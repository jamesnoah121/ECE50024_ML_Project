CGAN_Project_ML_50024

Please see the .ipynb Jupyter Notebook cGAN_Notebook.ipynb to see the output/evaluation of the cGAN. Training, Image Generation, and Model Evaluation all occurs in this file. Output from training has been cleared, but image generation and evaluation output is maintained. Models are saved off in repository for evaluation.'./saved_models'

All training was executed on Google Lambda Cloud, so some output will not be available in Jupyter Notebook (such as Loss Plots, etc.). As such the Jupyter Notebook may have some warnings. A 3 Epoch version is also saved off so all outputs and verification of code execution can be determined. Figures are saved into repository for viewing. See './Images_Report'

In order to do a proper FID Metric Evaluation, the saved models need to be properly linked (filepaths). This may require a simple path update.
